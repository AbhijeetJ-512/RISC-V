# 💾 **Memory Access Stage (MEM) - RISC-V Processor**  

## 📌 **Overview**  

The **Memory Access stage** is the fourth stage in the **RISC-V processor pipeline**. It is responsible for:  

✔️ Performing **load** and **store** operations.  
✔️ Accessing data memory when required.  
✔️ Passing data to the **Writeback stage** when needed.  
✔️ Handling memory-related control signals.  

This module is designed using **SystemVerilog** and is compatible with **Yosys, Icarus Verilog**, and other FPGA tools.
