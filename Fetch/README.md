# 🚀 **Instruction Fetch Stage (IF) - RISC-V Processor**  

## 📌 **Overview**  

The **Fetch stage** is the first stage in the **RISC-V processor pipeline**. It is responsible for:  

✔️ Fetching instructions from memory.  
✔️ Updating the **Program Counter (PC)**.  
✔️ Passing the instruction and PC values to the **Decode stage**.  

This module is designed using **SystemVerilog** and is compatible with **Yosys, Icarus Verilog**, and other FPGA tools.
