# ðŸš€ **RISC-V Processor Implementation**

## ðŸ“Œ**Overview**

This project implements a **pipelined RISC-V processor** using **SystemVerilog**. It follows the standard **five-stage pipeline** architecture:

1. **Fetch** â€“ Fetches instructions from memory.
2. **Decode** â€“ Decodes instructions and reads registers.
3. **Execute** â€“ Performs ALU operations.
4. **Memory Access** â€“ Handles memory read/write operations.
5. **Write Back** â€“ Writes results back to registers.

The processor is designed to support **basic RISC-V instructions** and can be extended for more advanced features like hazard detection and forwarding.
