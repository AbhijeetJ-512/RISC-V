# 🔍 **Instruction Decode Stage (ID) - RISC-V Processor**  

## 📌 **Overview**  

The **Decode stage** is the second stage in the **RISC-V processor pipeline**. It is responsible for:  

✔️ Decoding the fetched instruction.  
✔️ Reading values from the **register file**.  
✔️ Identifying instruction type and control signals.  
✔️ Passing decoded information to the **Execute stage**.  

This module is designed using **SystemVerilog** and is compatible with **Yosys, Icarus Verilog**, and other FPGA tools.
