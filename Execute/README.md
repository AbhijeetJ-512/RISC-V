# ⚙️ **Execute Stage (EX) - RISC-V Processor**  

## 📌 **Overview**  

The **Execute stage** is the third stage in the **RISC-V processor pipeline**. It is responsible for:  

✔️ Performing arithmetic and logical operations using the **ALU**.  
✔️ Computing the **branch target address**.  
✔️ Evaluating branch conditions for control flow changes.  
✔️ Selecting the appropriate operand using a **multiplexer**.  
✔️ Passing results and control signals to the **Memory stage**.  

This module is designed using **SystemVerilog** and is compatible with **Yosys, Icarus Verilog**, and other FPGA tools.
