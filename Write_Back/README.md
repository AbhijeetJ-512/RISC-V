# 🖋 **Writeback Stage (WB) - RISC-V Processor**  

## 📌 **Overview**  

The **Writeback stage** is the fifth and final stage in the **RISC-V processor pipeline**. It is responsible for:  

✔️ Writing the result back to the **register file**.  
✔️ Handling data from the **Execute** or **Memory Access** stage.  
✔️ Ensuring correct data forwarding for subsequent instructions.  

This module is designed using **SystemVerilog** and is compatible with **Yosys, Icarus Verilog**, and other FPGA tools.
